This repository will contain the code including pre-trained models for our paper "PTW: Pivotal Tuning Watermarking
for Pre-Trained Image Generators". 
We implement all watermarking methods and attacks presented in the paper and
provide access to pre-trained watermarked generator checkpoints.

**(May 24) The code will be released soon.**
